Redirect

command > text_file
output of command redirected to file

echo '1' > config
output of echo '0' is 
1
so config now config now contains 1.
This overwrites what was previously on config.
If config didn't exit, it will create the file.

If you don't want to overwrite, use '>>' to append
echo '2' >> config


Helpful hint.
This may come up configuring a system if you don't have write permissions
to a file like root_config, echo doesn't work, even if you 'sudo echo' (Why?)

If you are sure you want to modify the file use this:
	echo '1' | sudo tee root_config
Remember use man for commands you don't know.
